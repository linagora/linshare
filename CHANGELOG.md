**The 5.0.0 release of LinShare is out**

> **NB :**
> You can find the upgrade documentation [here](documentation/EN/upgrade).

- **core** : 5.0.0 - [changelog](https://github.com/linagora/linshare-core/compare/4.2.4...5.0.0)
- **ui-user** : 5.0.0 - [changelog](https://github.com/linagora/linshare-ui-user/compare/v4.2.4...v5.0.0)
- **ui-admin** : 5.0.0 [changelog](https://github.com/linagora/linshare-ui-admin/compare/v4.2.4...v5.0.0)

>**NB:**
>Before launching the upgrade process it is recommended to do a backup on the existing data in your Database.

#### Breaking changes:
  * **OIDC Authentication**
    * Drop supports for some **ui-user** oidc settings in **config.js**. Now only following settings are required: `authority`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `scope`.
    * Update redirection address for **ui-user**, the relative path of redirection address is now `#!/oidc/callback`. You are required to update settings of your OIDC Provider. See [LemonLDAP OIDC configurations](documentation/EN/installation/sso-lemonldap-using-OIDC.md#step-1-lemonldapng-configuration) for more details.

#### Main features:

* **Appearance**

    The logo of LinShare was updated along of the general theme:

  <img src="http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/5.0.0/03.LinShare.User.Home.page.png" alt="LinShare User Home page" width="600"/>


* **New administration interface (Beta)**

    With this new version, we had to introduce a new API (admin/v5) and its new
interface. Our main goal is to backport every old features of the old interface
but using up to date technologies (Vue.js 3). Of course, this will allow us to
redesign the whole interface, the whole user experience and to also bring new features.

* **Workspaces**

It was introduced in version 4.2 as  **Drive**, it was finally renamed as
**Workspace** to make more sense.

*Tiny remember of the feature:*

In LinShare we have workgroups in shared spaces. These groups are designed to make a team works together on one topic. If you have multiple topics in a team, you have to create one workgroup per team. This allows you to add different external people for each workgroup.

The main goals of `Workspace` are :

  * Regroup all worgkoups of a team in one item
  * Define default team members in the Workspace to avoid workgroup members redefinition
  * Manage globally team members rigths (right should be applied from workspace to its workgroups)
  * A workgroup can belong to a workspace or be standalone


* **User providers**

At first, LinShare was designed to retrieve users from a LDAP directory. These
users were called *Internal users*, they were able to create some temporary
accounts, called *guest users*.

In this version of LinShare, we added more user providers:

* OIDC user provider

This provider allows LinShare to create users "on-the-fly" at the first log in (using OIDC).

* Twake Console user provider

This provider allows LinShare to retrieve users from the Twake Console app, which is the portal of our new SAAS offer.

#### Main features

* **Drive**

In LinShare we have workgroups in shared spaces. These groups are designed to make a team works together on one topic. If you have multiple topics in a team, you have to create one workgroup per team. This allows you to add different external people for each workgroup.

The main goals of `Drive` are :

  * Regroup all worgkoups of a team in one item
  * Define default team members in the Drive to avoid workgroup members redefinition
  * Manage globally team members rigths (right should be applied from drive to its workgroups
  * A workgroup can be in a drive or be standalone

The Drive feature was introduced as an alpha verion (API only) on 4.0 version as we can see [here](https://github.com/linagora/linshare/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400-2020-07-16-download-link). In this 4.2 version of LinShare the Drive feature is ready, all related interfaces are created.

Now in the **SharedSpace** section the user is able to create a **Workgroup** or a **Drive**

![SharedSpace](http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.2.0/01.user.interface.shared.spaces.png)

![SharedSpaces list](http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.2.0/02.user.interface.shared.spaces.list.png)

In this screenshot we see when a Drive admin will add a sharedSpaceMember to his **Drive**, he needs to specify the new member's role on the Drive and on its nested Workroups.

By default the new member's roles are:
  * DRIVE READER on the Drive
  * READER on the nested workgroups

![Drive details](http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.2.0/03.user.interface.drive-detail.png)

In this screeshot we see the list of nested workgroups on a **Drive**

![Nested workgroups of a Drive](http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.2.0/04.user.interface.nested.workgroups-drive.png)

**Search on workgroup**

In this 4.2 version of LinShare an advanced search feature in order to allow a user to filter the created resources into the workgroup by:
   * Name
   * Types (Folder, Workgroup document or revision)
   * Resource kind (image, pdf, audio, archive ...)
   * Size
   * Creation and modification date
   * Last author on the workgroup

![Advanced search of workgroup nodes](http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.2.0/05.search.workgroup.nodes.png)

In this screeshot we will see the filter by type and creation date.

Now the recipient of the upload request is able to **preview** and **download** the uploaded documents.

**The 4.1.0 release of LinShare is out**

- **ui-upload-request** : 4.1.0 [changelog](https://github.com/linagora/linshare-ui-upload-request/releases/tag/v4.1.0)

#### Main features:

  * Upload request:

  The 4.1.0 version of LinShare updated the *Upload Request* feature which was introduced before, on the version 1.7.x.

  This feature consists of giving the ability to an Internal and guest users to send a request to an External user(just an email) to upload files.

  The recipient will receive an email saying that the issuer created an upload request for him and he can follow the link to an external portal where he will be able to upload his files, as we will see in the screenshots below.

  >**NB:**
  >The external user can access to the external portal and upload his files without having a LinShare account.

In this screenshot we can see the user interface for the upload request:

![User interface upload request](http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.1.0/02.user.interface.upload.request.png)

In the second screeshot we can see the received email where the recipient can access to the external portal:

![Activation email upload request](http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.1.0/03.activation.email.upload.request.png)


In the last screenshot we can see the external portal for the upload request on which the recipient is able to access, through the received mail, and upload his files:

![External portal upload request](http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.1.0/01.external.portal.upload.request.png)

* Authentication using OpenID Connect:

The new authentication process consists of delegating users' authentication to an external service called OIDC Provider, for that we have chosen to support the OpenID Connect (aka OIDC) as a technical solution, for more details you can follow the [official documentation](https://openid.net/connect/).

The LinShare roadmap, is to fully use the authentication using OIDC without the need of using LDAP, but curently it is still required to work.
Because users must be present in the LDAP during the OIDC authentication.

- *Technical information*:

We support the following flow : authorization code flow with pkce. For now, only access token with opaque format is handled.
Here is a documentation of [Opaque access token](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/access-tokens#opaque-access-tokens).

To enable/use the OIDC you can [see](https://github.com/linagora/linshare/tree/master/documentation/EN/administration/how-to-use-OIDC.md)

 In order to enhance the level of security of LinShare a second factor authentication is added.

 Here we can see the interface where the user can generate the shared key:

  <img src="http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.0.0/01.generate_Key_2fa.png" alt="init second factor shared key" width="600"/>

In the second screenshot we can see the interface where the user will enter  the received six digit code.

   <img src="http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.0.0/02.auth.png" alt="OTP six digit code" width="600"/>

* **Lockout account:**

 To avoid giving the attacker the time to guess the valid account credentials, a process of locking out an account is added to LinShare after unsuccessful consecutive attempts for a user login.

* **Change password:**

In LinShare 4.0.0 guests are able to change their passwords without using the reset/lost password feature.

In this screenshot we can see the interface where the guest will be able to change and enter the new password.

   <img src="http://download.linshare.org/screenshots/4.0.0/03.change_pwd.png" alt="change password" width="600"/>

   * **Passay** framework is added in order to enhance the complexity of the entered password, Here we can see the list of the different rules which should be respected in the entered password(Minimum/Maximum length, Minimum number of upper/lower case, Minimum number of digits, Minimum number of special characters).

   * The new entered password must be different from  the last 10 saved passwords.

* **Drive(alpha, API only):**

In LinShare we have workgroups in shared spaces. These groups are designed to make a team works together on one topic. If you have multiple topics in a team, you have to create one workgroup per team. This allows you to add different external people for each workgroup.

The main goals of `Drive` are :

  * Regroup all worgkoups of a team in one item
  * Define default team members in the Drive to avoid workgroup members redefinition
  * Manage globally team members rigths (right should be applied from drive to its workgroups
  * A workgroup can be in a drive or be standalone


*NB:* This feature is just implemented on **LinShare-core**, which means there is no user interface, there are just the different APIs of the feature.

#### Upgraded dependencies:

  - `JAVA` version is upgraded from 8 to 11
  - `Tomcat` is upgraded from 8 to 9
  - `PostgreSQL` is upgraded from 9 to 11
  - `MongoDB` is upgraded from 3.6 to 4.2

### Breaking changes:

  After upgrading process, you can change your password

  - As the password encoding strategy is updated, upgrade tasks are created to notify anonymous users and guests in order to reset their passwords.
